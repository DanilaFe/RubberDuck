## Contributing
Oh, golly, you wanna help?
Go right ahead!
Either submit an issue with the suggested phrase(s) or make a pull request. The source.txt file contains all the possible responses, separated by newlines. 
I'd prefer if you made pull requests regarding responses in the response-proposals branch.
